# Zoom Application Clone

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I have created a web version of popular video conferencing application called Zoom to deliver a platform to the user in which one can easily communicate and interact with larger groups all around.
A unique room id will be genrated each time when you open the webapp, later share the link with the person with whom you want to start the meeting and he will be in the same meeting room. <br/>
You have to give permission to your camera and microphone when using this app for the first time.

## Technologies Used ##
 - Node.js
 - Express JS
 - PeerJS
 - Socket.IO
